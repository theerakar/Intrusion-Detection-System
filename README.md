Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection SystemThis project implements a prototype for a real-time network intrusion detection system (IDS). It leverages a C++ application for live packet sniffing and a Python machine learning model for detecting anomalies or potential attacks based on captured network traffic.🚀 FeaturesLive Packet Capture: A C++ application captures network packets in real-time using the WinPcap (Npcap) library.Packet Feature Extraction: Extracts basic features (like packet length and timestamp) from captured packets.Real-Time Prediction: A Python script continuously reads new packet data and feeds it to a pre-trained machine learning model.Intrusion Detection: The machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier) classifies network traffic as "Normal Traffic" or "Attack".Modular Design: Separates packet capture (C++) from analysis (Python) for flexibility.🛠️ Technologies UsedC++ ComponentLanguage: C++Packet Capture Library: WinPcap (via Npcap SDK)Development Environment: Visual StudioPython ComponentLanguage: Python 3.xData Manipulation: pandasMachine Learning: scikit-learn (specifically DecisionTreeClassifier)Model Persistence: joblibDevelopment Environment: Python virtual environment (can be used with VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)📦 Project StructureIntrusion-Detection-System/

⚙️ Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesGit: For cloning the repository.Npcap (WinPcap): The packet sniffing library. Download and install Npcap from https://npcap.com/. Ensure "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode" is checked during installation.Npcap SDK: Required for compiling the C++ program. Download the Npcap SDK from https://npcap.com/ (usually listed under "Npcap SDK"). Extract it to a Libraries folder at the root of your Intrusion-Detection-System project (i.e., Intrusion-Detection-System/Libraries/Npcap SDK/).Visual Studio (for C++): Any recent version (e.g., 2019, 2022) with "Desktop development with C++" workload installed.Python 3.x: Installed on your system.1. Clone the RepositoryOpen your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository:cd C:\Users\your_username\Documents  # Or your preferred development directory
git clone https://github.com/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
cd Intrusion-Detection-System
2. C++ PacketSniffer SetupExtract Npcap SDK: Ensure you have extracted the Npcap SDK (e.g., Npcap SDK-1.x.x) into the Libraries folder at the root of your Intrusion-Detection-System project:Intrusion-Detection-System/
├── Libraries/
│   └── Npcap SDK/ # <--- This folder should contain 'Lib', 'Include', etc.
├── IDS_Project/
└── PacketSniffer/
Open in Visual Studio: Open the PacketSniffer.sln solution file located at Intrusion-Detection-System/PacketSniffer/PacketSniffer.sln in Visual Studio.Configure Project Properties:Right-click on the PacketSniffer project in the Solution Explorer and select "Properties".Navigate to "VC++ Directories":Include Directories: Add the path to the Npcap SDK's Include folder (e.g., $(SolutionDir)Libraries\Npcap SDK\Include).Library Directories: Add the path to the Npcap SDK's Lib\x64 folder (e.g., $(SolutionDir)Libraries\Npcap SDK\Lib\x64).Navigate to "Linker" > "Input":Additional Dependencies: Add wpcap.lib; ws2_32.lib; (These are crucial for networking).Build Solution: Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B or Build > Build Solution). This will create PacketSniffer.exe in PacketSniffer/x64/Release/ (or Debug/).3. Python Environment SetupNavigate to Python Project: Open your terminal and change directory to the Python project folder:cd C:\Users\your_username\Documents\Intrusion-Detection-System\IDS_Project
Create Virtual Environment:python -m venv .venv
Activate Virtual Environment:Windows:.\.venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
Train the Model: The decision_tree_model.pkl file is crucial for predictions. Run the training script:python train_model.py
This will generate decision_tree_model.pkl in the IDS_Project folder.🚀 How to RunTo run the real-time intrusion detection system, you need to execute the C++ packet sniffer and the Python real-time predictor simultaneously in separate terminal windows.Prepare C++ Output Directory:Inside your PacketSniffer folder, create a new empty folder named output. This is where the C++ program will save packet_data.csv.Start the C++ Packet Sniffer (Terminal 1):Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell.Navigate to the compiled C++ executable:cd C:\Users\your_username\Documents\Intrusion-Detection-System\PacketSniffer\x64\Release
Run the executable:.\PacketSniffer.exe
Follow the prompts to select your network interface (e.g., your Wi-Fi adapter). It will start capturing packets and writing to packet_data.csv in the output folder.Start the Python Real-Time Predictor (Terminal 2):Open a second new Command Prompt or PowerShell.Navigate to your Python project folder:cd C:\Users\your_username\Documents\Intrusion-Detection-System\IDS_Project
Activate your virtual environment:.\.venv\Scripts\activate
Run the real-time predictor script:python realtime_predictor.py
This script will wait for packet_data.csv to be created and then start printing real-time predictions as new packets are captured.✨ Future EnhancementsExpanded Feature Extraction: Implement more sophisticated packet parsing in C++ to extract a wider range of features (e.g., protocols, IP addresses, port numbers, flag counts) that are typically used in IDS datasets.Advanced Machine Learning Models: Experiment with more complex models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, or Neural Networks for improved accuracy.Alerting System: Implement an alerting mechanism (e.g., pop-up, log file, email notification) when an "Attack" is detected.User Interface: Develop a simple GUI (using Tkinter, PyQt, or a web framework) to visualize traffic, predictions, and provide controls.Database Integration: Store captured data and predictions in a database for historical analysis.Refined Preprocessing: Adjust the Python preprocessing to align more closely with real-time, single-packet feature scaling, potentially using MinMaxScaler fitted on the training data.📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
